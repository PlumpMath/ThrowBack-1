Hi, my name is Matt. Nice to meet you. Thanks for playing my game!

This entire game, such as it is, was created with zero dollars (besides, I guess, having an internet connection and a computer), using the following tools:
* Game Engine: Godot Engine
* Fonts: 1001freefonts.com
* Art: Inkscape/GIMP
If I'd had the time, I had sound tools in place as well: Bfxr (for sound) and SoundCloud (for music), but ran out of time to do it well, so decided to leave it out. Bad sound is way worse than no sound after all.

Thanks for checking out the game! Say hi on twitter if you liked it! @TheRealMatt_B

Current Issues:
* (NEEDS PLAY TESTING) All movement speeds, ball speed, scoring, literally every variable.
* fix glow across top bar
* make point displays hide after fading into goals
* change initial tail size to 1, maybe?
* glow on top looks bigger than glow on bottom
* don't restart timer. 99 sec for whole game, not per round
